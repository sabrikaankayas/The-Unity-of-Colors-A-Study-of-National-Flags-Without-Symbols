# Manifesto: The Unity of Colors

## Title: The Unity of Colors: A Study of National Flags Without Symbols

**Artist:** Sabri Kaan Kayaş 
**Date:** 2024

### Introduction
Flags are among the most powerful symbols of national identity. Each flag is adorned with colors and symbols that reflect a country's history, culture, and values. However, when we look beyond these symbols, we see a unity shared among flags, a diversity of colors. *The Unity of Colors* is an artistic exploration of the merging of colors and the celebration of diversity in a world where national symbols have been removed.

### Our Objective
This work transcends borders and symbols, focusing on the universal language of colors. Each flag loses its distinctions and transforms into a space where colors freely blend. This piece aims to offer a new perspective, turning flags—symbols of diversity and unity around the world—into a universal color palette.

### Artistic Process
Initially, the flags are presented with their national symbols intact. As the viewer interacts with the artwork, these symbols disappear, leaving only the fusion of colors. The blending of colors happens gradually and sequentially, revealing each flag's unique color palette as a unified whole. This transformation offers both a visual and emotional experience, as each flag transcends its national identity and becomes a harmony of colors.

### Message
*The Unity of Colors* reminds us that the diverse cultures and nations of the world are interconnected, much like colors that blend together. When symbols are removed, what remains are colors—representing the shared richness and diversity of humanity. This piece invites the viewer to explore the language of colors, to see unity within diversity, and to celebrate common human values beyond national identities.

### Conclusion
Colors carry a meaning that goes beyond symbols. *The Unity of Colors* brings forth the beauty of the colors behind flags, offering an artistic platform that celebrates the diversity and unity of the world. This work seeks to inspire viewers to imagine the colors of a shared future.
